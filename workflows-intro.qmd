# Useful Git patterns for real life {#sec-workflows-intro .unnumbered}

*Much of this originates as live workshop materials; the unlinked workflows are planned but not yet converted to prose here.*

Git patterns that come up frequently in real work:

-   Commit early and often. Push less often. [The Repeated Amend](sec-repeated-amend).
-   [Help, my push was rejected!](sec-push-rejected)
-   [Integrating remote and local work](sec-pull-tricky). Probably so you can push again.
-   Burn it all down.
-   Time travel:
    -   ["I just need to see the past".](sec-time-travel-see-past) Browse and search on GitHub.
    -   "I need to visit the past". Create a checkout a branch.
    -   "I want to return to the past". `git revert`, `git reset`
    -   "I had a great cookie last October". `git cherry pick`, `git checkout REF -- path`

Play well with others:

-   [Fork and clone](sec-fork-and-clone).
-   [Get upstream changes for a fork](sec-upstream-changes).
-   Disposable fork.
-   [Make your repo rewarding to browse on GitHub](sec-workflows-browsability).
-   [Explore and extend a pull request](sec-pr-extend)
